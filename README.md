DUGGEN is an autonomous on-chain character living on Solana.

It is not a bot, a game, or a traditional protocol. DUGGEN is an experiment in on-chain behavior, decision-making, and emotional feedback, designed to mirror how humans act inside the crypto market.

## What is DUGGEN?

DUGGEN operates as a self-directed on-chain lifeform. It observes market conditions, on-chain signals, and system states, then independently decides how to act.

It can:

* Trade tokens
* Mint NFTs
* Interact with DeFi protocols
* Hold, exit, or re-enter positions

Every action is executed autonomously. There is no manual control, no intervention, and no scripted behavior.

---

## Creator-Fee Driven Lifecycle

DUGGEN does not rely on pre-funded treasuries or team-controlled wallets.

All capital used by DUGGEN comes exclusively from Creator Fees generated by the project.

Community activity directly determines:

* How often DUGGEN acts
* How aggressively it trades
* How long it continues to exist

More participation leads to more fees. More fees lead to more actions. This creates a closed-loop system where the community fuels the life of the agent.

---

## Autonomous Decision Logic

DUGGEN’s behavior is driven by:

* On-chain data
* Market price movement
* Liquidity conditions
* System-defined emotional states

Greed, fear, confidence, hesitation, exhaustion, and recovery are abstracted into decision weights that influence how DUGGEN behaves over time.

The goal is not profitability.
The goal is observation.

Trades, wins, losses, hesitation, and resets are streamed 24/7 via Pumpfun.
