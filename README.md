It is not a game, not a bot, and not a traditional protocol. SBFMOD is a behavioral experiment that observes how crypto obsession, market psychology, and emotional feedback persist under isolation, pressure, and loss.

## What is SBFMOD?

SBFMOD operates as a self-directed on-chain entity. It continuously reacts to market conditions, price movement, and on-chain signals, making independent decisions without human intervention.

It may:

* Trade tokens
* Enter and exit positions
* React impulsively to volatility
* Collapse and restart

There is no script and no manual control. Every action is autonomous.

---

## Creator-Fee Driven Prison Loop

SBFMOD does not use pre-funded treasuries or team-controlled wallets.

All capital used by SBFMOD comes exclusively from Creator Fees generated by the project.

Community activity directly determines:

* How frequently SBFMOD trades
* How intense its behavior becomes
* How long the experiment continues

More interaction creates more stimulation. More stimulation accelerates the loop.

---

## Emotional Decision System

SBFMOD’s behavior is influenced by abstracted emotional states derived from market conditions:

* Greed
* Fear
* Hope
* Anxiety
* Delusion
* Exhaustion

These states affect decision weighting, creating a repeating psychological cycle rather than a profit-seeking strategy.

The objective is observation, not optimization.

Trades, liquidations, hesitation, and relapse cycles are streamed 24/7 via Pumpfun.
